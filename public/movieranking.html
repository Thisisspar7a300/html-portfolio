<h3>The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>I really like this movie because of the fantisy aspect and the 
    story. In the lord of the rings 4 Hobits set out to destroy the one ring
    that rules them all, to destroy the dark lord.

<h3>Deadpool 1, 2 and 3</h3>
<p>I like the Deadpool movies because it has allot of gory action, tons of adult humor
    and Ryan Rennalds is the main star.
</p>
<h3>Iron Man Movies</h3>
<p>I like The Iron Man movies because there is allot of action and i like 
    the story of how Tony Stark went from a Rich snob to a caring hero. i am also 
    a huge fan of Robert Doweny Jr.
